## Add a New Translation

Want to add a new language to our translations?

Create a new branch on Github.

In the `packages/tldraw/src/translations` folder, duplicate the `main.json` file.

Rename the new file to the [language code](https://gist.github.com/wpsmith/7604842) for that language. For example, if you were making an Esperanto translation, name the new file `eo.json`.

In the `packages/tldraw/src/translations/translations.ts` file, import your file and create a new entry in to the `TRANSLATIONS` array like this:

```ts
import ar from './ar.json'
import en from './en.json'
// import here ↲
import eo from './eo.json'

export const TRANSLATIONS: TDTranslations = [
  // Default language:
  { locale: 'en', label: 'English', messages: en },
  // Translations:
  { locale: 'ar', label: 'عربي', messages: ar },
  { locale: 'eo', label: 'Esperanto', messages: eo }, // <-- add an entry here
]
```

Translate the messages in the new file from English to your language.

That's it!

Submit your branch as a PR on Github.
